There are some docs ( at 11.04.2001 avaible docs for html, css, php, javascript )
you need to download packages from http://quanta.sourceforge.net
( html.tar.bz2, php.tar.bz2, css.tar.bz2 ) and uncompress them 
to $KDEDIR/share/apps/quanta/doc/ 
or to ~/.kde/share/apps/quanta/doc/ 
and restart quanta.
